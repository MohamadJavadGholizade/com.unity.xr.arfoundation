    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added [XRResultStatus](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRResultStatus), a new way for AR Foundation to provide status information for completed operations. Provider plug-ins can add extension methods to this type to give users access to platform-specific error codes and success codes.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed `SimulationPlaneSubsystem` to respect the currently set `PlaneDetectionMode`, detecting updates only from planes that match the current mode.\n- Upgraded `com.unity.xr.core-utils` dependency version from `2.2.3` to `2.3.0`.\n- Changed [ARTrackablesChangedEventArgs\\<TTrackable\\>](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARTrackablesChangedEventArgs`1):\n  - `added`, `updated`, and `removed` now return [ReadOnlyList](xref:Unity.XR.CoreUtils.Collections.ReadOnlyList`1) instead of `IReadOnlyCollection`, removing an unnecessary heap allocation when each collection is enumerated.\n  - `removed` now uses `KeyValuePair<TrackableId, TTrackable>` instead of `TTrackable`, allowing `ARTrackableManager` to send notifications of removed trackables even if you already destroyed them (for example, by destroying an `ARAnchor`).\n- Changed [Result\\<T\\>](xref:UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.Result`1):\n  - Removed `bool TryGetResult(out T)` and the constructor that took `(bool, T)` as parameters.\n  - Added `status`, `value`, and a constructor that takes `(XRResultStatus, T)` as parameters.\n- Updated Universal Render Pipeline documentation to reflect recent changes to URP concepts and setup.\n- Changed minimum Unity Editor version to `2023.3`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue where calling `ARSession.Reset` could cause XR Simulation plane detection to fail to discover planes for a period of time before resuming.\n- Fixed an issue where the `SimulationEnvironmentProbeSubsystem` could destroy environment probe GameObjects when they were removed, even if their **Destroy on Removal** property was set to false.\n- Fixed an issue where `EditorAnalytics` would throw obsolete warnings during project import in Unity 2023.2 or newer.\n- Fixed an issue in XR Simulation where a command buffer for the Built-in Render Pipeline was added to a camera even when URP was active."
